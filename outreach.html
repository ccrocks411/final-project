  <div class="para"> <p>Saint Josephs Womens basketball team takes alot of pride in giving back to the community. Throughout the year they do many different activites to help out. They volunteer at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia when there is special events such as CHOP prom. CHOP prom is for kids who may not ever get a chance to go on their school's prom so they hold one at the hospital. Kids get dressed up and have a fun night at the hospital, the basketball team dance the night away with patients and make sure that they are having a great time. CHOP also has special events for different kind of patients so one week they may have a special event for patients with cleft lip, and the players will work stations such as finger painting, making cotton candy and racing kids on the obstacle courses. 
                </p>
