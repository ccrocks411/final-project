        <p> For my final project I wanted to create a website for my basketball team but not just the old boring type of page I wanted to have it from a players perspective. I added things such as some experiences on the road and show the community service work that we do throughout the year. I wanted the website to look fun and appealing to people when they visted it, I watned it to reflect how the team is. For the home page I wanted 4 picutres on it with the links to their pages underneath them. This was a hassle for me to do. I needed them lined up with 2 on the top next to each other and then 2 directly beneath them in the same format. I had to create 2 seperate div classes for the picture one for the picutres on the left and the pictures and then float them and put the right margin and padding. One of the hardest things to do for the website was the top menu bar for users to get back and forth to each page. I did not want to use any bootstrap material, one thing I took pride in was figuring out how to make everything so i could learn from my mistakes and fix them. I made my menu options a a list then I floated them to the left so they could be side by side. After that I played with padding, margin and text align till I got it the way I wanted to. One thing that I could not figure out was to have my header center on my pages. Since my menu bar was a little low it was in the way of having my header center. For my style I wanted to stick to Saint Joes colors which are maroon, white and grey. So my background is maroon in all the pages, my font colors are grey and white. I tried to have fun fonts, but also have a font that is readable and not hard on the eyes.</p>
       <p>On my roster page I listed every player and had their picture on top of their name. I think this was another one of hardest things to figure out how to do. I learned from my home page how to float two images next to each other but here I had 12 pictures. I wanted to have 2 rows of 6. I created one div called "img with txt" for all the pictures. After that I went into CSS and chnaged up the display its margins, width and height. Once I got the pictures aligned I nedded to put the persons name underneath their respective picture. This turned out to be more of a hassle then I expected. For starters i had to find a font that was readable at a smaller size. Next, everytime I put the font underneath the picutre it pushed my pictures out of line and I would end up with a 6 5 1 line up when I wanted a 6 6 line up of pictures. This required me to go back and change the line up of my pictures and make certain margins bigger or smaller so I could include the names. I also realized that when I changed the margin in my pictures it affected my other pages. So i had to created new divs in order for the pictures on the other pages not to be affected. I learned alot of things while making this website. First thing is that this takes alot of freaking skill and problem solving. Second is that the little things matter, at one point in my project one of my divs were not working because in my CSS I had forgot a letter in one of my classes. Another thing that I learned is that making certaing things in list can help align things and that came in useful alot with my website. Overall I like my website and for the most part is what I envisioned it to be. If I had more time i would have liked to learn how to create a border around my webpage but with a repetitive picture. I would have liked to have the sju hawks logo going around the border of my webpage but that is something I could not figure out. Also this is probally really advanced but it would be nice to have a photo gallery that moves on itself like a slideshow. This way I can get more pictures on the page and not have it take up to much space.
